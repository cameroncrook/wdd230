                <h3>Proximity</h3>
                <h5>Malwarebytes</h5>

                <p>
                    I think the design that Malwarebytes uses here is a great example
                    of the proximity principle.

                    When we view elements of design near each other within a composition, 
                    we perceive those elements as related. By placing elements away from one another, 
                    a designer is able to convey that there is no relationship between them. 
                    The relationship between elements creates relevancy, organization, structure, 
                    and hierarchy.

                <p>
                    When designers move elements closer together or farther apart, 
                    they are employing the principle of proximity. 
                    There are two major reasons why a designer would employ proximity: 
                    to create connections or deploy them.
